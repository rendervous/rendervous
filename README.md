### Rendervous

Rendervous is a project designed primarily for academic purposes. The core idea is the integration of GPU rendering capabilities including ray-tracing (Vulkan) with deep learning (Pytorch).

As a result you have a differentiable renderer that can be included in learning models and vice versa, learning models that can be included as renderer components (materials, scattering functions, parameters, etc).
